Different runs:

phot - Fitting only the photometry with the physical model described in Carnall et al. (2019b) without any calib/noise model.

v1 - Fitting DR3 spectra + photometry with the model described in Carnall et al. (2019b) except for the Gaussian process (second term in Equation 6).

v11 - Fitting DR3 spectra + photometry with the full model described in Carnall et al. (2019b).
