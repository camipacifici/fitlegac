This directory contains the results of Sirio's fits.

The fits were done using Drew Newman's pyspecfit (Newman et al. 2014), following pretty much the methods outlined in Belli, Newman & Ellis (2019). For each galaxy, the LEGA-C spectrum and the broadband photometry are fit simultaneously. Models are from the Bruzual & Charlot 2003 (BC03) library, using a Chabrier IMF, and adopting a Calzetti dust law. Since gas and dust are not modeled, the IRAC data from channel 3 and channel 4 have been excluded from the fit, and the LEGA-C spectrum was masked in the locations corresponding to [OII], [OIII] and Hbeta. The star formation history is a piecewise model with nodes at lookback times of 0.0, 0.35, 0.70, 1.5, 3.0, 6.0 Gyrs. This means that all galaxies started forming 6 Gyr before, independent of their redshift. The file dofit_102266.py shows an example of the code used to set up the fit, and contains more details, e.g., about the prior on each parameter.

The output of the fitting for the whole sample is stored in the single file LEGA-C_fit_sirio.fits. This can be read, e.g. in IDL, with:

IDL> x = mrdfits('LEGA-C_fit_sirio.fits',1)

It's an array of structures, with each structure corresponding to one galaxy:

For each physical property the 16th, 50th, and 84th percentiles are given. The properties are:

AGEM: mass-weighted age, calculated by integrating SFR(t)*t, where t is the lookback time.
AGEL: light-weighted age, calculated by integrating F(t)*SFR(t)*t, where F(t) is the flux in the Cousins R band for an SSP with solar metallicity as a function of age t, according to BC03.
METAL: metallicity, where 0.02 is solar. In my models all stars have the same metallicity
LMSTAR: log of stellar mass (Msun). It includes dark remnants but not gas returned to the ISM
AV: dust attenuation in the V band.

Then the LAMBDA, BESTFIT, RESIDUALS are arrays containing the best-fit spectrum and the residuals, with RESIDUALS = DATA - BESTFIT. USEDPIX is a flag: it's 1 for pixels that were included in the fit and zero for pixels that were excluded. Note that the bestfit typically covers a wide range, and a lot of the pixels at the edge are flagged with USEDPIX=0 because there are actually no data there. USEDPIX is set to 0 also in the regions near emission lines.

CHI_SPEC: reduced chi-square for the spectroscopy. This is rescaled before the fitting, so it's almost exactly 1 in all cases.
CHI_PHOT: reduced chi-square for the photometry. This can be used to identify bad fits. A good rule of thumb is CHI_PHOT > 2 to select problematic fits; there are seven such objects in this sample.

The vectors LOOKBACK_TIME and SFH_BESTFIT contain the SFH, i.e., SFR(t) in units of Msun/yr. Also, 100 draws from the SFH posteriors are stored as SFH_i with i=00...99.
