Using DR3 - May 23, 2019

*by Adam, Anna, Cami, Joel, Sirio

The list of IDs and data have been circulated by Rachel (email).

Requested outputs:

- age, light-weighted (r band) and mass-weighted
- metallicity, light-weighted (r band) and mass-weighted
- observed stellar mass and total mass formed
- A_V
- full SFH
- best-fitting spectra and residuals

Everyone has their own folder to upload files.

NO ORIGINAL DATA IN THIS REPOSITORY PLEASE!

Happy fitting!
